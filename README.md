This project is a simple command-line calculator built using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations by entering two numbers and selecting the desired operation.

🚀 Features

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/) with division by zero handling

📝 How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.

The user selects an operation from the given options:

1 → Addition

2 → Subtraction

3 → Multiplication

4 → Division

The program performs the calculation and displays the result.

If the user selects division and the second number is 0, it shows an error message instead of crashing.

Invalid operation choices are handled gracefully with an appropriate message.
